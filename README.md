# Axe-game-Raylib
Made first Game with the help of Gamedev.tv course in c++ with Raylib.

Started learning C++ and Raylib with a course from www.gamedev.tv on udemy.

To play the game- 
Use keys A and D to move the circle left and right respectively avoiding the axe (Square).
I have not implemented the points system yet in this game as i am still learning .
If you hit the square the game will be over.
